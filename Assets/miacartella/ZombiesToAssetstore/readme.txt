Hello,
Thank you for buying my product. Here I will quickly explain it.

First, the main point of this product is the zombie models. While i prepared a scene so they come towards the camera and can be shot, it is for showcasing the zombies only. My programming skills are low, so i used a lot of hacky and shady solutions.

In the "Zombie_Models" folder you find the "raw" fbx files, ready to be used. If you want to use a different texture on them, you have to put it on them manually, or you can use a script for that (for example "GetRandomTexture"). Note that the textures cannot be changed between zombie types.

Animations:
idle: the zombie stands still.
shamble: the zombie goes forward, with a broken leg.
walk: the zombie moves forward normally.
fallToFace: the zombie falls to its face. Also good for dying.
beginToCrawl: from the end position of "fallToFace", the zombie goes to the start position of "beginToCrawl". A bit unneccessary since one can just transit the animation, but oh well.
crawl: the zombie crawls forward. When played on normal speed, this is actually faster than walking.
standUp: the zombie stands up from crawling.
fallBack: the zombie falls to its back, like hit by something.
hit1-2: the zombie is "getting hit".
attack1-2: the zombie attacks with his hands.

Well, i hope you like the product, if you want anything, contact me on
